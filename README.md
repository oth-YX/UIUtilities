### UIUtilities for iOS

Helper classes for UI fixes

This is a group of categories that I find quite useful in the development phase.

As the project progress more categories will be added.

All thanks for Marc of darkdust.net. This project is inspired by him.

#### UIView+ColoredBorderAroundComponents
Draws a borders arround every UI component drawn on screen.

Blue colored borders are around UI component that was drawn from the xibs.

Red colored bordered components was given frames programmically through code.


#### Utilities
Now you can resize an existing image easily.
